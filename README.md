# Learning about graphics

- Examples using [HTML5 canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) mainly based on [Keith Peter's course in Egghead.io](https://egghead.io/courses/learn-html5-graphics-and-animation). [My notes on Canvas](CANVAS.md).

- Examples using [fabric.js library](http://fabricjs.com/), many of them extracted from fabric.js [articles](http://fabricjs.com/articles/) in documentation. [My notes on fabric.js](FABRIC.md)
